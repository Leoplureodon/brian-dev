      <Typography>
        I'm a developer with extensive experience in web development, game
        design, and creating interactive digital experiences. Throughout my
        career, I have had the privilege of working on a diverse range of
        projects, from small, independent ventures where I served as the sole
        developer, to large-scale international collaborations as part of
        multidisciplinary teams. My ability to adapt to different project
        environments, whether working independently or within global teams, has
        enabled me to deliver high-quality solutions consistently.

        I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology to create
        immersive, user-centered experiences. My work spans a variety of
        industries, including entertainment, technology, and business, and I
        thrive on the challenges that come with developing innovative solutions.
        Whether itâ€™s optimizing web applications, building games that engage
        users on a deeper level, or crafting seamless interactive interfaces, I
        am driven by a desire to turn creative ideas into reality.

        When not working I enjoy video games, home automation, finding things to
        3d print, and some occasional matches of Magic The Gathering.
