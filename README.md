# Brian O'Rourke's Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my portfolio, available at [brianorourke.ie](https://www.brianorourke.ie/). This is a modern React-based site built with TypeScript and Material UI, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background.

## Key Features

- **React and TypeScript**: Built with a focus on maintainability and type safety using React 18 and TypeScript.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: Utilizes Material UI components for responsive and accessible design, with Notistack for toast notifications.
- **Vite**: Blazing fast development experience with Vite.
- **Private C# Backend**: A private C# backend handles serving my CV as a downloadable PDF, ensuring that bots canâ€™t easily access it.
- **Contact Form with Web3forms**: Secure contact form integrated with Web3forms for handling form submissions.
- **GitHub Pages Hosting**: The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy deployment and accessibility.
