      <Typography>
        I’m a developer with experience in web, game design, and interactive
        digital projects. I’ve worked on small independent ventures as the sole
        developer, and large international collaborations, delivering
        high-quality solutions in both.

        I’m passionate about pushing technology's limits to create immersive
        user experiences. My work spans entertainment, tech, and business, from
        optimizing web apps to building engaging games and interactive
        interfaces.

      <Typography>
        Outside of work, I enjoy video games, home automation, 3D printing, and
        the occasional Magic: The Gathering match.
